# scripter
You think you need a Scripter...
You have the right tools to do this.

# 1) Requirements
You'll need Resource Hacker (http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/reshacker_setup.exe)
And that's it!

# 2) Creation
Download the file and install the genuine copy of Resource Hacker onto your computer.
Once done, create a new project (click the blank file icon).
And then for the file details, type this:

1 VERSIONINFO
FILEVERSION 5,812,10240,16384
PRODUCTVERSION 5,812,10240,16384
FILEOS 0x4
FILETYPE 0x1
{
BLOCK "StringFileInfo"
{
	BLOCK "040904B0"
	{
		VALUE "CompanyName", "Sutton's Program"
		VALUE "FileDescription", "Scripter Host"
		VALUE "FileVersion", "9.5.1.0"
		VALUE "InternalName", "scripter.exe"
		VALUE "LegalCopyright", "\xA9 Sutton's Program. All rights reserved."
		VALUE "OriginalFilename", "scripter.exe"
		VALUE "ProductName", "Sutton's \xAE Scripter Host"
		VALUE "ProductVersion", "9.5.1.0"
	}
}

BLOCK "VarFileInfo"
{
	VALUE "Translation", 0x0409 0x04B0  
}
}

You can modify the values to be whatever you want.


Do note that the version in the excutable is 9.5.1.0, don't worry about that.
That's because the scripter.exe was created before this was uploaded to GitHub.
It is actually v2.0.
# That's it!
You're done now. That's it!
